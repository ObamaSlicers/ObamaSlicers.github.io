        <dt class="hobbies">Video Games</dt>
        <dd class="hobbiesindepth">The primary hobby I enjoy doing is playing video games. I range from playing first person shooter games like Valorant to basic simple games like Minecraft and Roblox. When I'm off my computer and on my phone, I play Brawl Stars, Battle Cats, and BTD 6 (Balloon Tower Defense 6) My life primary rely on video games because their fun and gives me a quick shot of dopamine after spending hours at school</dd>

        <dt class="hobbies">Read Anime</dt>
        <dd class="hobbiesindepth">When I'm tired of video games and need something else to do with my time, I enjoy reading or watching anime since it's very insteresting exploring the story and plot of them. Some animes I'm currently on right now is Shinmai Ossan Boukensha, One piece, etc. So far, I'm waiting for Jujutsu Kaisen season 3 and One Punch Man season 3 to be animated. The primary genre I focus on is primary action based animes because I don't wanna watch those weird and obnoxious romantic animes with peculiar titles.</dd>

        <dt class="hobbies">Reading</dt>
        <dd class="hobbiesindepth">Once I'm tired of being on my computer, I choose to spend some time reading, not for the story, but for myself, since reading can help develop your vocabulary since you may stumble across new and unknown words. I like reading mangas, novels, or just simple graphic novels like DogMan. </dd>
