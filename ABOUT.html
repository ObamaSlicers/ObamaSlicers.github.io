I made this website because of a project given to be in my Web Design and Development 1 class where we need to implement what we learned from CSS and HTML to build a website about me.</p>

Instead of seeing parents struggling with working 7-8 hours daily, I could give them loads of money, so they wouldn't need to be able to work a day in their life, bringing joy and happiness because they deserve it. Also, if catch any illness or whatsoever, I could just pay for the BEST and MOST EXPENSIVE treatment and doctor to help cure the illness. </p>
